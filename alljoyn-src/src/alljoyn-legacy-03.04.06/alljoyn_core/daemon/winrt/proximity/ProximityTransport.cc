/*
 * The purpose of this code is really to ensure that we don't have any listeners
 * active on Android systems if we have no ongoing advertisements.  This is to
 * satisfy a requirement driven from the Android Compatibility Test Suite (CTS)
 * which fails systems that have processes listening for TCP connections when
 * the test is run.
 *
 * Listeners and advertisements are interrelated.  In order to Advertise a
 * service, the name service must have an endpoint to include in its
 * advertisements; and there must be at least one listener running and ready to
 * receive connections before telling the name service to advertise.
 *
 * Discovery requests do not require listeners be present per se before being
 * forwarded to the name service.  A discovery request will ulitmately lead to a
 * bus-to-bus connection once a remote daemon has been discovered; but the local
 * side will always start the connection.  Sessions throw a bit of a monkey
 * wrench in the works, though.  Since a JoinSession request is sent to the
 * (already connected) remote daemon and it decides what to do, we don't want to
 * arbitrarily constrain the remote daemon by disallowing it to try and connect
 * back to the local daemon.  For this reason, we do require listeners to be
 * present before discovery starts.
 *
 * So the goal is to not have active listeners in the system unless there are
 * outstanding advertisements or discovery requests, but we cannot have
 * outstanding advertisements or discovery requests until there are active
 * listeners.  Some care is obviously required here to accomplish this
 * seemingly inconsistent behavior.
 *
 * We call the state of no outstanding advertisements and not outstanding
 * discovery requests "Name Service Quiescent".  In this case, the name service
 * must be disabled so that it doesn't interact with the network and cause a CTS
 * failure.  As soon as a either a discovery request or an advertisement request
 * is started, we need to enable the name service to recieve and send network
 * packets, which will cause the daemon process to begin listening on the name
 * service well-known UDP port.
 *
 * Before an advertisement or a discovery request can acutally be sent over the
 * wire, we must start a listener which will receive connection requests, and
 * we must provide the name service with endpoint information that it can include
 * in its advertisement.  So, from the name service and network perspective,
 * listens must preceed advertisements.
 *
 * In order to accomplish the CTS requirements, however, advertisements must
 * preceed listens.  It turns out that this is how the high-level system wants
 * to work.  Essentually, the system calls StartListen at the beginning of time
 * (when the daemon is first brought up) and it calls StopListen at the end of
 * time (when the daemon is going down).  Advertisements and discovery requests
 * come and go in between as clients and services come up and go down.
 *
 * To deal with this time-inversion, we save a list of all listen requests, a
 * list of all advertisement requests and a list of all discovery requests.  At
 * the beginning of time we get one or more StartListen calls and save the
 * listen specs, but do not actually do the socket operations to start the
 * corresponding socket-level listens.  When the first advertisement or
 * discovery request comes in from the higher-level code, we first start all of
 * the saved listens and then enable the name service and ask it to start
 * advertising or discovering as appropriate.  Further advertisements and
 * discovery requests are also saved, but the calls to the name service are
 * passed through when it is not quiescent.
 *
 * We keep track of the disable advertisement and discovery calls as well.  Each
 * time an advertisement or discover operation is disabled, we remove the
 * corresponding entry in the associated list.  As soon as all advertisements
 * and discovery operations are disabled, we disable the name service and remove
 * our TCP listeners, and therefore remove all listeners from the system.  Since
 * we have a saved a list of listeners, they can be restarted if another
 * advertisement or discovery request comes in.
 *
 * We need to do all of this in one place (here) to make it easy to keep the
 * state of the transport (us) and the name service consistent.  We are
 * basically a state machine handling the following transitions:
 *
 *   START_LISTEN_INSTANCE: An instance of a StartListen() has happened so we
 *     need to add the associated listen spec to our list of listeners and be
 *     ready for a subsequent advertisement.  We expect these to happen at the
 *     beginning of time; but there is nothing preventing a StartListen after we
 *     start advertising.  In this case we need to execute the start listen.
 *
 *   STOP_LISTEN_INSTANCE: An instance of a StopListen() has happened so we need
 *     to remove the listen spec from our list of listeners.  We expect these to
 *     happen at the end of time; but there is nothing preventing a StopListen
 *     at any other time.  In this case we need to execute the stop listen and
 *     remove the specified listener immediately
 *
 *   ENABLE_ADVERTISEMENT_INSTANCE: An instance of an EnableAdvertisement() has
 *     happened.  If there are no other ongoing advertisements, we need to
 *     enable the stored listeners, pass the endpoint information down to the
 *     name servcie, enable the name service communication with the outside
 *     world if it is disabled and finally pass the advertisement down to the
 *     name service.  If there are other ongoing advertisements we just pass
 *     down the new advertisement.  It is an AllJoyn system programming error to
 *     start advertising before starting at least one listen.
 *
 *   DISABLE_ADVERTISEMENT_INSTANCE: An instance of a DisableAdvertisement()
 *     call has happened.  We always want to pass the corresponding Cancel down
 *     to the name service.  If we decide that this is the last of our ongoing
 *     advertisements, we need to continue and disable the name service from
 *     talking to the outside world.  For completeness, we remove endpoint
 *     information from the name service.  Finally, we shut down our TCP
 *     transport listeners.
 *
 *   ENABLE_DISCOVERY_INSTANCE: An instance of an EnableDiscovery() has
 *     happened.  This is a fundamentally different request than an enable
 *     advertisement.  We don't need any listeners to be present in order to do
 *     discovery, but the name service must be enabled so it can send and
 *     receive WHO-HAS packets.  If the name service communications are
 *     disabled, we need to enable them.  In any case we pass the request down
 *     to the name service.
 *
 *   DISABLE_DISCOVERY_INSTANCE: An instance of a DisableDiscovery() call has
 *     happened.  There is no corresponding disable call in the name service,
 *     but we do have to decide if we want to disable the name service to keep
 *     it from listening.  We do so if this is the last discovery instance and
 *     there are no other advertisements.
 *
 * There are four member variables that reflect the state of the transport
 * and name service with respect to this code:
 *
 *   m_isListening:  The list of listeners is reflected by currently listening
 *     sockets.  We have network infrastructure in place to receive inbound
 *     connection requests.
 *
 *   m_isNsEnabled:  The name service is up and running and listening on its
 *     sockets for incoming requests.
 *
 *   m_isAdvertising: The list of advertisements is reflected by current
 *     advertisements in the name service.  if we are m_isAdvertising then
 *     m_isNsEnabled must be true.
 *
 *   m_isDiscovering: The list of discovery requests has been sent to the name
 *     service.  if we are m_isDiscovering then m_isNsEnabled must be true.
