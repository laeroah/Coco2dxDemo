 AllJoyn for Windows Runtime API Reference Manual
@section subsection1 Overview
AllJoyn is a device-to-device communication protocol which enables mobile devices to support peer-to-peer applications such as multi-player gaming and social networking.

AllJoyn is designed as a backwards-compatible extension of DBus, a standard protocol for inter-application communication in the Linux desktop environment. It offers the following features:

- Cross platform/OS/device
- Peer-to-peer communication
- Simplified service discovery
- Flexible security framework and trust models
- Transport agnostic / multi-protocol support
- Multi-language support for the AllJoyn API


This document describes the Windows Runtime bindings for the AllJoyn API.
