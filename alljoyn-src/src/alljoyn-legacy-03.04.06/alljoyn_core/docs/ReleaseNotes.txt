None


Issues Addressed in Version 3.4.6
---------------------------------

AJCORE-321: About client cpp sample release variant binary prints wrong port.

AJCORE-329: Fix deadlock situation that arises because of improper ordering when
trying to acquire NameTable lock and SessionlessObject lock.

AJCORE-331: CPU usage on Linux goes very high while running stressful
sessionless signal tests.  Change busy-waits to Event::Wait and force remove
exit alarms.

AJCORE-339: Fix crash that occurs if the endpoint exits before the auth thread
has been joined.

AJCORE-733: Avoid name propogation and send only local daemon names during
initial ExchangeNames for sessionless sessions.  Also, reduce traffic between
older and newer daemons to the extent possible and ignore unnecessary
information sent out.

AJCORE-740: Change order of StartStream and RegisterEndpoint to fix deadlock if
RemoteEndpoint is stopped before it can be completely started.

Known Issues
------------

About feature not yet supported on platforms other than Linux and Android.

ALLJOYN-1967: AllJoyn daemon cannot (quickly) detect disconnection of non-local
client connection such as thin-client connection

ALLJOYN-2192: AllJoyn thin client does not support header compression

ALLJOYN-2374: AllJoyn thin client binding cannot send/receive messages larger
than 55KB

ALLJOYN-2504: Calling GetPeerGUID from RequestCredentialsAsync callback may
cause deadlock when AllJoyn is built with OpenSSL without multi-thread support

ALLJOYN-VARIOUS: JavaScript and Win8/RT language bindings do not currently
support the new object based security APIs.

ALLJOYN-VARIOUS: Win8/RT bindings do not currently support new API changes to
report reason for lost session

ALLJOYN-VARIOUS: Win8/RT bindings do not currently support new API changes to
allow removal of member from multipoint session


Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.

Version 3.0.0 shipped with an issue (ALLJOYN-1423) that prevented earlier versions
of AllJoyn from seeing multicast advertisements produced by 3.0.0 based
applications. This issue was addressed in version 3.0.1.

Version 3.3.0 is the first version of the AllJoyn daemon that is compatible with
AllJoyn thin client usage. Older daemons cannot be used with AllJoyn thin-clients.

Starting with version 3.3.0, the AllJoyn Java binding call
BusAttachement.registerSignalHandler() no longer implicitly adds a match rule
that allows all globally broadcast signals of the given interface to be received.
Beginning with version 3.3.0 of the Java binding, the application developer is
responsible for explicitly calling BusAttachment.AddMatch with a rule that
matches the globally broadcast signals that the app wishes to receive.

Starting with version 3.4.0 the AllJoyn daemon and sample programs use a common
shared library called liballjoyn.so on Linux and OpenWrt. In order to run these
programs, you will need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to
include the directory where liballjoyn.so is located.

Version 3.4 of the AllJoyn ICE transport changed the hostname for the Rendezvous
server from rdvz.alljoyn.org to connect.alljoyn.org. As a result, pre-3.4 versions
of AllJoyn cannot discover or connect using the ICE transport.
